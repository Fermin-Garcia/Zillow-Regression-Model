# Zillow Single Family Properties Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to create an improved regression model to predict the property tax assessed values ('taxvaluedollarcnt') of single family properties that had a transaction during 2017.

## Goals
- Develop a regression model to accurately predict the property tax assessed values.
- Identify the key drivers of property value.
- Deliver a report outlining the steps taken, key findings, and recommendations.
- Prepare for a 5-minute presentation to present findings to the Zillow data science team.
